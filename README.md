# Biostats-Assignment-Journal-Impact-Factor
Journal Impact Factor was devised as a metric to quantify the impact of individual research journals. It is currently used/misused for many different purposes!

For a specific year, Journal Impact Factor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor) for a particular journal is calculated as the mean number of citations received in that year by articles published in th at journal during the last two years.

For eg. for the a particular journal, JIF (2019) = (Number of citations received in 2019 by all citable articles published in 2017 and 2018) / Total number of citable articles published in 2017 and 2018

I have calculated the imapct factor for Journal of Neuroscience (2020)
